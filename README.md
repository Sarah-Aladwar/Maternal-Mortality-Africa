👩🏽‍⚕️ A Data-Driven Group Project by **Health for Her**

**Women Techsters Bootcamp 2025 | SDG 3.1 Project**

---

## 🧭 Introduction

This project was developed as part of the **Women Techsters Data Analysis Bootcamp 2025**, a collaborative learning initiative to empower women in tech.

Our team, **Group 7 – Health for Her**, worked together to investigate maternal mortality in Africa using real-world data and analytical tools. The goal was to apply our data skills to a critical public health issue aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) **3.1**:

> _"Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030."_

## 📌 Project Overview

We explored the trends and regional disparities in maternal mortality across African countries from **2012 to 2022**, and examined how **healthcare spending** relates to maternal health outcomes. Using visual and statistical insights, we offer recommendations for smarter policy and investment strategies.

- Assess the impact of health expenditure on maternal outcomes  
- Identify regional disparities and high-risk zones  
- Propose actionable recommendations to reduce maternal mortality

## 📊 Data Sources

All data were obtained from the **World Bank Open Data Portal**:

- Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)  
- Number of Maternal Deaths  
- Lifetime Risk of Maternal Death  
- Current Health Expenditure (% of GDP)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Over **2 million maternal deaths** were recorded in the last decade  
- **West and East Africa** account for the highest death rates, despite relatively high spending  
- **Central Africa** shows significant risk with limited investment  
- Regional differences highlight the need for **targeted health policies**

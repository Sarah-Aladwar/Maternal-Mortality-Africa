## 🧭 Introduction

This project was developed as part of the **Women Techsters Data Analysis Bootcamp 2025**, a collaborative learning initiative to empower women in tech.

Our team, **Group 7 – Health for Her**, worked together to investigate maternal mortality in Africa using real-world data and analytical tools. The goal was to apply our data skills to a critical public health issue aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) **3.1**:

> _"Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030."_

## 📌 Project Overview

We explored the trends and regional disparities in maternal mortality across African countries from **2012 to 2022**, and examined how **healthcare spending** relates to maternal health outcomes. Using visual and statistical insights, we offer recommendations for smarter policy and investment strategies.
